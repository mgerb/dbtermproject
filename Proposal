Subscription Database
Mitchell Gerber and Jason Carpenter

	We will be creating a subscription service. It will store and hold user data, purchase data, and subscription statuses. The source of our data will be generated examples done by hand. As most of the data is user specific. Five data tables will be utilized. A User Data table, which will contain Name, Username, and last-name and person specific account information. There will be a purchase database with credit card info, subscription length remaining, and purchase success. There will be a user service data, which will hold in avatar information, location, and game data. A guilds table which will contain player association lists, similar to a friends list from other social media applications. There will be a game data table with will have quest information, location in world, and various other details. The user ui will have a quests log that will allow completion of quests from the page. This will manifest as a Boolean indicator in the quests table.

	The application will consist of several ui pages. A primary login page for userâ€™s that are already subscribed. Upon login the user will be presented with a ui that displays the combined data from the user table, purchase table, and guild table. A basic logout and register page will also be included. 

Tiered design:
1.	A browser ui for searching the database
2.	A data filter for input and output formatting
3.	The database itself
